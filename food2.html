                              <p>Food is a great way to connect with family and friends and change the system. There are easy ways to share the importance of reducing meat and dairy with the people you love.</p>

                                <h1>1.  Re-work your favorite traditional family recipe to reduce the meat and dairy</h1>
                                <p><b>Less meat, more taste! Tips for giving family recipes a makeover</b>
                                  <br><br>
                                   <b>Traditional family recipes are so important to all of us</b> – the thought of adapting something with such emotional value may seem daunting. But, there are ways you can adjust a special traditional family recipe to keep its importance to you while decreasing or removing the meat and dairy within it. Try these two approaches:
                                    <br><br>
                                   <b>If you want to reduce the amount of meat and dairy:</b> Flip the veggie-to-meat ratio. Many recipes have a meat to veggie ratio of four to one or more. If you don’t want to cut out the meat entirely, you can flip the ratio so that you still have the meat in the dish, but have more veggies than meat. This will keep the flavor, reduce the environmental footprint, and increase the healthfulness of the dish. You can even use the money saved by buying less meat and dairy to buy higher quality ecological meat and dairy.
                                    <br><br>
                                   <b> If you want to replace the meat and dairy:</b> Swap out the meat and dairy with plant protein sources and other veggiesMany people in the world actually consume more protein than they need. However, if you are concerned about retaining the protein content of your dish, you can replace the meat/dairy with plant protein. Legumes (beans, peas, and lentils), certain grains, nuts, and seeds are all high in protein. You can also use tofu, tempeh, seitan, textured vegetable protein, and plant-based milks and cheeses.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Swapping out one starch for another can also do wonders for your meal. You can replace the type of starch with one that is equally delicious but has more protein content. For example, dishes that call for white rice, pasta, or potatoes can be replaced by cornmeal, wheat berries, teff, quinoa, whole wheat pasta, wild rice, millet, couscous, oatmeal, or buckwheat.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <b>Share your results</b><br>
                                    Once you’ve put a new spin on your traditional family recipe, try inviting family members to make the new version with you at the next family occasion. Share photos of the old and new versions and what you changed on social media. Even challenge your friends and family to try making the new version themselves.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <b>Who knows – maybe your new and improved version will become the new tradition!</b></p>

                                         <b> 11 things everyone should know about industrial meat and dairy</b>
                                          <br><br>
                                          Industrial meat and dairy production impacts our climate, our forests, our water, and our health. Want to share info with friends and family about the problem but don’t know where to start? We’ve got you covered. These eleven facts illustrate the sheer magnitude of the damage caused by industrial animal agriculture.
                                          <br><br>
                                          <list >
                                            <li>The sheer number of livestock on Earth is mind-boggling. The number of chickens, pigs and cattle slaughtered per capita more than tripled between 1961 and 2009, reaching over ten animals slaughtered for every person on Earth in 2009.</li>
                                           <br> <li>Industrial agriculture is a rapidly growing threat to the climate. If we don’t do something, 52% of climate emissions are projected to be from agriculture by 2050, and 70% of those will likely be from livestock.</li>
                                           <br> <li>Livestock use a quarter of all land on Earth. Total land used for livestock grazing equates to around 26% of the terrestrial surface of the planet.</li>
                                           <br> <li>Poop from industrial meat and dairy is choking oceans and lakes. Industrial livestock is responsible for accelerating growth of dead zones. The number of dead zones has increased by 75% since 1992.</li>
                                           <br> <li>The livestock sector contributes as much to climate change as all cars, planes, trains, and boats combined. Livestock emissions account for 14% of greenhouse gas emissions, about the same as the emissions from the whole transport sector.</li>
                                            <br> <li>Producing meat can be a real drain on water resources. Beef takes six times more fresh water to produce than lentils and beans, per gram of protein.</li>
                                            <br> <li>Processed meat has been classified as potentially causing cancer. In 2015 the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified red meat as ‘probably carcinogenic to humans’ and processed meat as a ‘carcinogenic to humans.’</li>
                                            <br> <li>Less meat could mean more food for more people. Science suggests that changing our dietary preferences toward plant-rich diets will reduce environmental costs and feed millions of people with no additional natural resource use.</li>
                                            <br> <li>Livestock use a lot of medication. In fact, the routine, extensive and increasing use of antimicrobial products in livestock production is an important challenge for animal and human medicine.</li>
                                            <br> <li>Eating more veggies and less meat can be life-saving. We could avoid 5 million deaths a year if the world shifted to healthier diets with more veggies and legumes and less meat. That’s 9 people a minute.
