                            <div class="act">
                                <p>Young people in the UK who have been striking for the climate are calling on adults to join them on<b> Friday 20 September </b>as part of a massive global day of action.</p>
                          <p><b>“This is not a single-generation job. It’s humanity’s job... Let’s all join together, with your neighbours, co-workers, friends, family and go out on to the streets to make your voices heard and make this a turning point in our history.”</b> Greta Thunberg and 46 youth activists from the international school strike movement</p>
                                <h2>What can I do?</h2>
                          <p>Spread the word! This can be online - for example, share the Facebook event - but face to face conversations are best. Lots of energy and mobilising will take place in existing campaigns, communitiy groups etc. But this is a day where there will also be actions organised from workplaces, whether that's a strike, a short walkout to join young people a stoppage or some other solidarity action. There's a guide here for adults wanting to get involved or you can get some inspiration from the video below.
                            <br><br>
                                You can talk to people in your workplace about why this is so important. Think about holding a meeting to discuss what action you can take. If you can, invite a school striker or climate activist. Be creative and imaginative. Tell your employer about the strength of feeling in support of backing the young people. </p>
                          <h2>Global action</h2>
                          <p>The 20th September Global Climate Strike will start a week of global action across the world. There will be strike events in at least 137 countries. Trade Unions and workers across the world are organising to support the Global Climate Strike on 20th which will begin the week of action. Trade Unions for Energy Democracy have collated some of the statements and union support and action planned across the world. 
                                <br><br>
                                Over 900 Amazon employees have signed an internal petition pledging to walk out over their employer’s lack of action on climate change, the first time in Amazon’s 25-year history that workers at its Seattle headquarters have walked off the job, though many are taking paid leave to do so. Facebook and Google employees are also planning to join.
                                <br><br>
                                In Australia, strike organisers have got over 1,200 businesses, Australian and global, to pledge to enable workers to join the strike, using the hashtag #NotBusinessAsUsual.</p>

                                    There's lots happening across local government where Unison branch officers, reps and members have worked hard to deliver action for the 20th. Rightly, given that many Councils have declared a Climate Emergency, Union members have asked councils to put words into action, starting with support for 20th September.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Here's some examples of the kind of action being planned. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    In Salford Unison have negotiated that all workers will be able to join a rally outside the Town Hall, any worker who wants to will then be able to attend the protests in central Manchester, without penalties.
