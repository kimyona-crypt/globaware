            <h1>Restore Forests. Restore Hope.</h1>
            <p1>Demand companies stop deforestation</p1><br>
            <p>We are living through a climate and wildlife emergency. One million species are at risk of extinction and people all over the world are already starting to see the effects of the climate crisis.
                    <br><br>
                    From Brazil to Indonesia, forests all over the world are being destroyed to make way for the production of commodities such as soya, palm oil, and cattle. These forests are essential for winning the fight against the climate breakdown. Yet, some of the biggest brands in the world, like Nestlé, Unilever, Mondelez and many others are still profiting from forest destruction.
                    <br><br>
                    These companies must end “business as usual” to avoid the worst effects of climate chaos.</p>

                        <h1>The Problem</h1>
                        <p>Ten years ago, hundreds of the world's biggest companies promised to end forest destruction by 2020. With only a few months left, they are nowhere near this goal. Instead they expanded into new areas of forest and savannah, converting once pristine landscapes into cattle ranches to grow commodities like soya and palm oil. We can't accept empty promises anymore. We must protect and restore our forests and other ecosystems to keep our planet habitable and manage the climate crisis.</p>

                        <div class="column">
                        <h1>The Solution</h1>
                        <p>Forests are our life support systems. They help regulate our climate and support the diversity of life on Earth, but they are being pushed to the brink of collapse by companies driven by profit over the planet. We need systemic change to avoid climate chaos. Companies must fulfill the promises they made years ago. They must prove their products are not causing deforestation, reduce their meat and dairy use and restore ecosystems back to health.</p>

                                <h2>Countdown to Extinction</h2>
                                <p><b>We’re living through a climate and ecological emergency.</b><br>
                                    Ecological and climate breakdown share many of the same drivers: notably, the destruction of forests and other natural ecosystems by industrial agriculture. Some 80% of global deforestation is a result of agricultural production, which is also the leading cause of habitat destruction. Animal agriculture – livestock and animal feed – is a significant driver of deforestation, and is also responsible for approximately 60% of direct global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Halting deforestation and restoring the world’s forests is the cheapest and fastest way to reduce GHG emissions and ensure rapid carbon uptake.
                                        <br><br>
                                        At the 2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Cancun, members of the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) committed to eliminating deforestation by 2020 through the responsible sourcing of the commodities most linked to forest destruction: cattle, palm oil, pulp and paper, and soya.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Yet, despite these commitments, global commodity production remains a leading cause of forest destruction. Analysis by Greenpeace International suggests that, by the start of 2020, some 50 million hectares of forest – an area the size of Spain – are likely to have been destroyed for global commodity production since those promises were made in 2010.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Meanwhile, the trade in high-risk commodities has boomed: since 2010, the area planted with soya in Brazil has increased by 45%, Indonesian palm oil production is up 75% and Côte d’Ivoire’s cocoa footprint has grown by 80%. And the trend is set to continue: by 2050, global meat consumption (and hence production) is forecast to rise by 76%, soya production by nearly 45% and palm oil production by nearly 60%.
                                        <br><br>
                                        In early 2019, Greenpeace challenged more than 50 traders, retailers, producers, and consumer goods companies to demonstrate their progress towards ending deforestation by disclosing their cattle, cocoa, dairy, palm oil, pulp and paper, and soya suppliers. Not a single company was able to demonstrate meaningful effort to eradicate deforestation from its supply chain.
                                        <br><br>
                                        We have just over a decade to get GHG emissions under control if we are to limit global warming to below 1.5°C. Preventing climate and ecological breakdown will require transformative changes to the way forests are managed and agricultural commodities are produced, dramatic reductions in meat and dairy consumption and the phasing out of crop-based biofuels and bioplastics.
                                        <br><br>
                                        The onus is on brands that use high-risk commodities like beef, palm oil, and soya to demonstrate that their supply chains are free from deforestation. Brands must also slash their use of meat and dairy, leading to a more than 70% reduction in per capita consumption in high-consuming areas such as North America and Europe by 2030. This means replacing industrially produced milk, pork, beef, and poultry products with healthy and affordable plant-based foods.</p>
